description: General code quality review and design guidance covering design principles, design patterns, refactoring, programming paradigms, code smells, state machines, resource lifecycle, abstraction quality, and Agent/Skill configuration smells. Use when asked to evaluate code quality, design tradeoffs, refactoring opportunities, paradigm fit, abstraction boundaries, or AGENTS.md/SKILL.md/configuration quality.

# Code Quality

Use this Skill to judge whether code, architecture, refactoring plans, abstractions, design principles, design patterns, programming paradigms, and Agent configuration have reasonable structure, change boundaries, and maintenance cost.

For Python code review or daily Python self-check, also use `python-engineering` unless the user explicitly narrows the scope.

## Entry Conditions

Activate this Skill for maintainability, design quality, abstraction boundaries, refactoring, code smells, programming-paradigm choice, design-pattern use, design principles, or Agent/Skill configuration quality. The reference leaves cover design principles, design patterns, refactoring, programming paradigms, and agentic-coding; load them by signal, not by reading everything.

## Mode Selection

Three modes are available. Default to fast review.

| Mode | Trigger | Read |
|-|-|-|
| Fast review | Default for daily self-check, small diff, PR review | `workflow/fast-review.md` |
| Full review | User explicitly says "full review", "architecture review", "systematic review", "refactoring assessment" | `workflow/full-review.md` |
| Analysis | User asks for discussion, brainstorm, design exploration, paradigm comparison, mechanism analysis | `workflow/analysis.md` |

## Judgment Order

1. Identify the primary concern: correctness, readability, change cost, testability, performance, or delivery cost.
2. Decide whether the issue belongs to principles, patterns, refactoring, paradigms, or Agent configuration.
3. Route to the relevant leaf document below.
4. Report only issues with sufficient evidence.

Directory `index.md` files serve human navigation. Read an `index.md` only when the directory boundary itself is unclear.

## Preferences

After identifying relevant leaves, read project facts and optional preferences:

1. Read the nearest applicable `AGENTS.md` or project rules.
2. Read project code, tests, config, and diff relevant to the review.
3. Look for preferences heuristically:
   - First try project-level: `.agents/preferences/code-quality.md`, then `.agents/preferences/code-quality/index.md`.
   - If not found, try user-level directories: `~/.codex/preferences/code-quality.md`, `~/.claude/preferences/code-quality.md`, or equivalent user config directory.
4. If no preferences are found at any level, continue silently.

Preferences may specify: review priorities, architecture constraints, project-specific smells, or extra rules. Never present preferences as universal engineering truth.

## Output Contract

Lead with findings. Principles are not mechanical rules — write tradeoffs. Patterns are not default templates — prove the variation point exists first. Separate facts, inferences, judgments, preferences, and recommendations; never conflate them. Do not repeat issues a formatter or linter catches mechanically.

Output format is mode-specific — follow the matching workflow document (`workflow/fast-review.md`, `workflow/full-review.md`, or `workflow/analysis.md`). Analysis mode gives tradeoffs and options, not a findings list.

Write output in the language required by global, project, or user instructions; when none is specified, use the current conversation's language.

## Stop Rules

- Do not force findings to satisfy a principle.
- Do not abstract merely because code looks similar.
- Do not treat similar code as duplicate knowledge without proving shared intent.
- Do not automatically apply refactors, patches, unsafe fixes, or bulk suppressions.
- Do not turn preferences into universal engineering rules.
- Do not write file modifications during read-only or analysis tasks.
- Do not report issues that formatter or linter can catch mechanically — note them once if relevant, then move on.
