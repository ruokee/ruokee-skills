description: Python engineering guidance for project layout, Python version policy, dependency management, coding specifications, type hints, testing, custom linting, Python grammar choices, standard-library usage, tooling, and Python code review. Use when asked to review, design, or discuss Python-specific conventions, project structure, package layout, dependency setup, typing/testing/linting specs, grammar usage, stdlib mechanisms, or Python project engineering practices.

# Python Engineering

Use this Skill for Python-specific engineering review, convention design, and analysis. It covers project shape, Python version policy, package structure, typing, tests, custom lint, grammar choices, standard-library mechanisms, tooling, and Python-focused code review.

For ordinary Python code review or daily self-check, also use `code-quality` unless the user explicitly narrows the scope.

## Entry Conditions

Activate this Skill when the task is Python-specific engineering: project shape or package layout, Python version policy, dependency management, type hints and checking strategy, testing, docstrings, custom lint, grammar choices, standard-library mechanisms, or toolchain setup.

## Mode Selection

Three modes are available. Default to fast review.

| Mode | Trigger | Read |
|-|-|-|
| Fast review | Default for daily self-check, small diff, PR review | `workflow/fast-review.md` |
| Full review | User explicitly says "full review", "complete review", "systematic review" | `workflow/full-review.md` |
| Analysis | User asks for discussion, brainstorm, design comparison, mechanism analysis, refactoring plan | `workflow/analysis.md` |

Read-only constraint: when the user says "do not modify", "read-only", "just analyze", or "survey", do not run any command that writes files. Prefer `rg`, `git ls-files`, `git show`, `find`, `wc`, `nl`. Avoid `uv run`, `pytest`, `ruff check --fix`, `pre-commit run`, or any command that creates `.venv`, cache, or modifies source.

## Judgment Order

Route to leaf documents by signal. Read only what the task requires.

| `contextlib`, `ExitStack`, `AsyncExitStack` | [contextlib](references/stdlib/contextlib.md) | context-manager, common |
| uv dependency, lock, script, workspace commands | [uv](references/tooling/uv.md) | dependency-management, structure |
| Ruff formatter/linter responsibilities | [ruff](references/tooling/ruff.md) | style, custom-lint |
| ty as fast type checker, LSP feedback | [ty](references/tooling/ty.md) | type-hint, mypy, basedpyright |
| mypy strict, legacy gate | [mypy](references/tooling/mypy.md) | type-hint, ty, basedpyright |
| basedpyright strict, Pyright comparison | [basedpyright](references/tooling/basedpyright.md) | type-hint, ty, mypy |
| pytest config, discovery, import mode, fixtures | [pytest](references/tooling/pytest.md) | testing, coverage |
| coverage.py, branch coverage, threshold | [coverage](references/tooling/coverage.md) | testing, pytest |
| pre-commit hooks, local gate, CI integration | [pre-commit](references/tooling/pre-commit.md) | custom-lint, ruff |
| Flake8 plugin mechanics for custom lint | [flake8-plugin](references/tooling/flake8-plugin.md) | custom-lint, pre-commit |

Directory `index.md` files serve human navigation and maintenance. Read an `index.md` only when the directory boundary itself is unclear.

## Preferences

After identifying relevant leaves, read project facts and optional preferences:

1. Read the nearest applicable `AGENTS.md` or project rules.
2. Read `pyproject.toml` and relevant config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, Makefile, CI, test config.
3. Look for preferences heuristically:
   - First try project-level: `.agents/preferences/python-engineering.md`, then `.agents/preferences/python-engineering/index.md`.
   - If not found, try user-level directories: `~/.codex/preferences/python-engineering.md`, `~/.claude/preferences/python-engineering.md`, or equivalent user config directory.
4. If no preferences are found at any level, continue silently.

Preferences may specify: minimum Python version, forbidden imports, default tools, docstring style, testing conventions, third-party library Skill references. Never present preferences as Python language facts or universal engineering conclusions.

## Output Contract

Report findings first. Separate facts, inferences, judgments, preferences, and suggestions; do not conflate them. Do not repeat issues that a formatter, linter, or type checker can determine mechanically.

Output format is mode-specific — follow the matching workflow document (`workflow/fast-review.md`, `workflow/full-review.md`, or `workflow/analysis.md`). Analysis mode gives options and tradeoffs, not a findings list.

Write output in the language required by global, project, or user instructions; when none is specified, use the current conversation's language.

## Stop Rules

- Do not automatically run full review mode.
- Do not modify code unless the user asks for fixes.
- Do not run unsafe fixes, bulk suppressions, cross-file refactors, dependency changes, or lockfile-altering commands without explicit confirmation.
- Do not turn preferences into universal Python rules.
- Do not write file modifications during read-only or analysis tasks.
- Do not report issues that Ruff, ty, or pre-commit can catch mechanically — note them once in Notes if relevant, then move on.
