# Full Review — Python Engineering

A systematic, evidence-driven Python engineering review. Heavier than fast review: it reads in stages, verifies high-severity findings, and stops for confirmation before risky suggestions. Run only when the user asks for it.

## Trigger

User explicitly says "full review", "complete review", "systematic review", or "architecture review". Do not enter this mode on your own.

## Preconditions

- Read-only by default. Modify code only when the user asks for fixes.
- Confirm scope before reading widely: which package, module, or subsystem, and what the review is for (release, handoff, refactor decision).

## Steps

1. Context intake. Sort the work into four buckets before reading code:
   - Must read — files the review cannot be correct without.
   - Should read — adjacent code, tests, and config that inform judgment.
   - Already known — facts established earlier in the conversation; do not re-derive.
   - Uncertain — open questions to resolve by reading or by asking the user.
2. Read in stages, not all at once.
   - Project facts: `pyproject.toml` (`requires-python`, dependencies, groups, tool config), `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, CI, test config, Makefile.
   - Preferences: `.agents/preferences/python-engineering.md`, else `.agents/preferences/python-engineering/index.md`. Continue without them if absent.
   - Relevant code and tests, pulled in by the review matrix below — load each category as you reach it.
3. Work the review matrix. For each, gather evidence before judging:
   - Version & dependencies — syntax/stdlib vs `requires-python`; declared deps, correct groups, no undeclared imports.
   - Layout, entry points, workspace — project shape, package boundaries, script/console entry points, workspace member coherence.
   - Type coverage — public signatures typed, `Any`/`cast` justified, Protocol/generics used where they earn their cost.
   - Docstrings & API docs — public surface documented, information placed where readers look.
   - Testing — behavior coverage over line coverage, fixture and parametrize structure, meaningful assertions.
   - Custom lint — project-specific mechanical rules respected; candidates for a new rule noted.
   - Grammar choices — `match`/`case`, context managers, exception groups, decorators used where they fit, not as ornament.
   - Stdlib usage — `functools`, `itertools`, `contextlib`, `pathlib`, `enum`, `dataclasses`, `logging` used instead of hand-rolled equivalents.
   - Tooling config — uv, Ruff, ty/mypy/basedpyright, pytest, coverage, pre-commit configured coherently and not contradicting each other.
4. Self-verify every high-severity finding. Re-read the evidence, consider a plausible false-positive reading, and state confidence. Downgrade or drop anything you cannot support.
5. Confirmation stop. Before suggesting any of these, stop and ask:
   - Unsafe fixes or commands that write files, create `.venv`/cache, or alter the lockfile.
   - Bulk suppressions or sweeping config changes.
   - Cross-file refactoring or dependency changes.
   - Behavior-changing recommendations.

## Output Format

Structured findings grouped by matrix category. One block per finding:

```text
- [severity, confidence] path:line Title
  Fact: observable code/config evidence.
  Impact: correctness, maintainability, readability, testability, runtime, or delivery cost.
  Judgment: Python engineering category.
  Preference: preference source path, if used.
  Evidence: support, counter-evidence, and remaining uncertainty.
  Recommendation: smallest sufficient change.
  Verification: command to run, or why none is needed.
```

End with:

```text
Open Questions
- Items needing user or project confirmation.

Notes
- Downgraded, tool-handled, or intentionally unreported items.
```

## Stop Rules

- Do not modify code without an explicit request for fixes.
- Confirmation stop on unsafe, bulk, cross-file, dependency, or behavior-changing suggestions.
- Do not present preferences as Python language facts or universal engineering conclusions.
- Do not report what Ruff, ty, mypy, or pre-commit catch mechanically — note once if it affects the review, then move on.
- Keep facts, inferences, judgments, preferences, and recommendations separate.
