# Deep Research

A structured, evidence-first, in-depth research process.

The deep-research has no token budget and no time budget. The more detailed the better; conduct a broad and in-depth survey within your capabilities.

## Workflow

Strictly follow the procedures below.

1. **Clarify the Research Question**
    - What exactly needs to be researched?
    - What level of detail is required?
    - Are there specific angles to prioritize?
    - What is the purpose of the research?

2. **Identify Key Aspects**
    - Break the topic into subtopics or dimensions
    - List main questions to answer
    - Note important context or background needed

3. **Broad Exploration**
    - Start with broad searches to understand the landscape
    - Search for the main topic to understand the overall context
    - From initial results, identify key subtopics, themes, angles, or aspects that need deeper exploration
    - Note different perspectives, stakeholders, or viewpoints that exist
    - Don't let the first one or two sources define the entire direction of the investigation

4. **Deep Dive**
    - For each important dimension identified, conduct targeted research
    - Search with precise keywords for each subtopic
    - Try different keyword combinations and phrasings
    - Read important sources in full, not just snippets
    - When sources mention other important resources, search for those too

5. **Validation**
    - Ensure comprehensive coverage of diverse information types, fetch and read the most important sources in full
    - When multiple sources repeat the same statement, they should be considered as part of the same chain of evidence, integrated and cross-verified
    - Mark important claims as facts, inferences, judgments, propaganda, or unresolved uncertainties
    - Do not write a definitive conclusion when the supporting relationships are unclear

6. **Summarize**
    - Compile and summarize the key findings from the research
    - Provide summary of conclusions, sources list, full report, and any unresolved questions
    - Write the output based on the evidence
    - Present facts, inferences, judgments, recommendations, and questions to be confirmed separately

## Fetching

Suitable for `Broad Exploration` and `Deep Dive`.

The preferred approach is to save the original content as a verifiable Markdown source file using Skills or MCP in user space. If valid webpage content is unavailable, at least a detailed summary, key excerpts, URLs, authors, publication dates, and access date should be saved for later analysis.

Sources:

- Official documents, articles, blogs, reports, statistics: authoritative sources
- General websites: require independent verification

## Principles

- The quality of your output directly depends on the quality and quantity of research conducted beforehand. A single search query is NEVER enough.
- Prioritize finding primary sources: official documents, papers, publication pages, and direct product documentation.
- Secondary sources should only be used to discover clues, supplement background information, or aid in comparisons.
- Separate source collection and final synthesis to avoid drawing premature conclusions.

## Output

Research requires the production of reports and documents by default, unless otherwise specified by the user.

The original materials, analysis, and cross-validation processes from the research should also be documented in as much detail as possible.

## Sub-Agents

- Use sub-agents as much as possible for parallel collection, processing, and analysis.
- The maximum number of sub-agents that can run concurrently depends on the limitations of the environment.
- If the number of tasks to be assigned exceeds the limit, queue them and start new sub-agents only after the preceding tasks have completed.
- Please wait patiently for sub-agents to complete their tasks.
- Intervene ONLY if a task has not been completed for more than 30 minutes, or if the user provides new instructions.
- Timeout intervention does not mean immediate termination. Correct it if possible, and save the current state only if it cannot be corrected.
