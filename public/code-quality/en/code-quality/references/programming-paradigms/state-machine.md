# State Machine / Finite-State Model

A state machine models a process as a finite set of named states, a set of events, and the rules governing movement between them. The question it answers is not "class or function?" but: which states can the system be in right now, what events does it accept, which transitions are legal, how are illegal ones rejected, and what side effects fire on transition. This is one of the highest-leverage models in everyday engineering, because so many bugs are really illegal-state bugs wearing a different costume.

It is not a synonym for the GoF State pattern. That pattern is one *object-oriented implementation* of a state machine. The model is broader and can be expressed as a transition table, an `Enum` plus dispatch, a `match` statement, a pure reducer function, or state objects.

## Concept

A state machine captures a workflow as data: the modes a thing can occupy, the triggers that move it, and the policy for everything that is not allowed. Making the legal moves explicit turns "we forgot to handle the case where a cancelled order gets paid" from a latent production bug into a single missing table entry you can see and review.

## Core Model

- **State** — a named, mutually exclusive mode the system occupies (`draft`, `submitted`, `paid`). At any moment it is in exactly one.
- **Event** — a named trigger that may cause a transition (`submit`, `pay`, `cancel`). Events are facts or commands arriving from outside the machine.
- **Transition** — a legal movement from one state to another in response to an event: `(state, event) -> next_state`.
- **Guard** — a precondition on a transition. Even if a transition exists, the guard can block it: sufficient balance, valid permission, resource still present.
- **Action** — a side effect performed when a transition is taken: write the database, send a message, emit an event, record an audit entry.
- **Invalid transition handling** — the explicit policy for an event the current state does not accept: raise, reject, or no-op. This is a decision, never an unhandled branch that silently does nothing.

## When Appropriate

- The states are finite and can be named, and the events are finite and can be named.
- Invalid transitions matter — moving from `cancelled` to `shipped` must be impossible, not merely unlikely.
- Lifecycle correctness is part of the domain: orders, approvals, subscriptions, protocol/connection state, job and worker lifecycles.
- You need to audit *why* `A -> B` is allowed and `A -> C` is not, often for compliance.
- The process interacts with persistence, retry, or concurrency, where a precise notion of "current state" prevents corruption.

## When Not Appropriate

- A simple linear flow with no branching and no notion of an illegal step.
- Tiny, obvious branching where a boolean field or a single `if` already reads clearly.
- No real concept of an invalid state — any value can follow any other without harm.
- Pre-building a class per state for a two-state problem; that is class explosion, not modeling.

## Typical Implementations

- **Enum + transition table** — a `dict[(State, Event), State]`. The clearest default when rules are stable. Reviewable at a glance, trivially testable.
- **Pure reducer** — a function `(state, event) -> new_state` with no side effects, so the imperative shell performs actions. Pairs naturally with [functional-core.md](./functional-core.md).
- **`match`/`case`** — good for local, structured transitions with modest branching. It is a syntax for expressing transitions, not the state machine itself.
- **Dispatch map** — `dict[Event, Callable]` when each event carries distinct handling logic.
- **State objects (GoF State)** — when each state genuinely has substantial differentiated behavior (connection states, editor modes, protocol phases).
- **Library / workflow engine** — when you need persistence, visualization, or dynamic configuration and have a real need for it, not speculation.

## State Design

- States must be **mutually exclusive**. If two can be true at once, they are not states of one machine — they are two machines or two dimensions.
- Name states in **domain terms** (`awaiting_payment`), not implementation terms (`flag2_set`).
- **Avoid boolean combinations** as implicit state. `is_active`, `is_locked`, `has_failed`, `is_retrying` as four independent booleans encode 16 combinations, most of them illegal and none of them defined. Collapse them into one named state enum.
- Model **events as verbs or facts** (`pay`, `OrderPaid`), distinct from states. Confusing the two ("the `paying` event") is a sign the model is muddy.

## Transition Table / Diagram

Every non-trivial workflow deserves an explicit transition table or diagram. It can be code (a literal dict the program executes) or documentation (a Markdown table or a state diagram). The code form is best because it cannot drift from behavior. The point is that someone can see the whole legal-move set in one place and ask "is this complete? is this correct?" without tracing scattered conditionals across the codebase.

```python
from enum import StrEnum


class Order(StrEnum):
    DRAFT = "draft"
    SUBMITTED = "submitted"
    PAID = "paid"
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"


class Event(StrEnum):
    SUBMIT = "submit"
    PAY = "pay"
    CANCEL = "cancel"


TRANSITIONS: dict[tuple[Order, Event], Order] = {
    (Order.DRAFT, Event.SUBMIT): Order.SUBMITTED,
    (Order.SUBMITTED, Event.PAY): Order.PAID,
    (Order.DRAFT, Event.CANCEL): Order.CANCELLED,
    (Order.SUBMITTED, Event.CANCEL): Order.CANCELLED,
}


class InvalidTransition(ValueError):
    pass


def apply_event(state: Order, event: Event) -> Order:
    try:
        return TRANSITIONS[state, event]
    except KeyError as exc:
        raise InvalidTransition(f"{state} cannot handle {event}") from exc
```

## Review Model

Review a state machine in three passes, in order:

1. **Completeness** — are all states enumerated? all events? Is every `(state, event)` pair either an intended transition or an intended rejection? Are terminal states identified (`closed`, `cancelled` accept nothing further)?
2. **Correctness** — are guards correct and total? Are actions idempotent so a replayed or retried event does not double-charge or double-send? Is concurrent application safe (two events racing on the same entity)?
3. **Representation** — only now ask whether a table, a `match`, or state objects best expresses it. Get the model right before arguing about the form.

## Quick Signals

Reach for this model when you see:

- Status strings assigned in scattered places with no single definition of the legal set.
- Combinations of boolean flags standing in for state, with no enforced legal combinations.
- `if/elif` ladders that check both current state *and* incoming event inline, repeated across several functions.
- Repeated events causing duplicate effects — a sign actions are not idempotent and transitions are not gated.

## False-Positive Boundary

A status enum on its own is **not** a state machine — it is just a named value until there are transition rules governing how it changes. Adding a transition table to genuinely trivial branching is over-engineering; if there is one obvious linear path and no illegal-state concern, the table is ceremony. The model earns its weight when illegal transitions are real and correctness matters. Apply it there, not everywhere a status field appears. See [object-oriented.md](./object-oriented.md) for when state plus behavior belongs in an object, and [declarative.md](./declarative.md) for why the table form is so reviewable.
