# Event-Driven Architecture

## What it is

Event-driven architecture treats events as first-class facts: something happened, and that fact is recorded and published rather than directly triggering a known piece of code. A producer emits an event (`OrderPaid`, `FileUploaded`, `user.signup`) without knowing or caring who consumes it. Consumers subscribe to the events they care about. The coupling between them is the event schema, not a direct function call.

This shows up at many scales: in-process signals and hooks (Django signals, pytest hooks, Qt signals), pub/sub within an application, and message queues or event buses across services (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, Redis streams). The unifying idea is the same — invert the dependency so the thing that *causes* a state change does not hold a reference to everything that must *react* to it.

## The assumption underneath

- Producers and consumers change for different reasons and should be deployable, testable, and reasoned about independently.
- "Something happened" is a more durable interface than "call this specific handler." New reactions can be added without touching the producer.
- For some systems the event log itself is valuable: an append-only record of facts is a natural audit trail and a basis for replay.

## When appropriate

- **Decoupling producers from consumers.** One action needs to trigger several unrelated reactions (send email, update analytics, invalidate cache) and you do not want the originating code to know about all of them.
- **Audit trails and event sourcing.** The sequence of events *is* the source of truth; current state is a projection. This gives replay, temporal queries, and a built-in audit history.
- **Asynchronous workflows.** Work that should not block the request path — notifications, indexing, downstream processing — is naturally expressed as "emit event, let a worker handle it."
- **Extension points.** Plugins and hooks let third parties react to lifecycle events without modifying core code.

## Risks

Event-driven systems trade explicit control flow for decoupling, and that trade has real costs:

- **Hidden control flow.** You cannot read a producer and know what happens next; the reactions are elsewhere. This is the same debugging difficulty noted in [declarative.md](./declarative.md), amplified — the call graph is assembled at runtime through subscriptions.
- **Ordering and delivery.** Events may arrive out of order, be delivered more than once, or be lost. Consumers usually must be idempotent (processing the same event twice causes no extra effect) — the same property a [state-machine.md](./state-machine.md) needs for repeated events.
- **Error context.** When a consumer fails, the failure is far from the producer in both code and time. Reconstructing "what led to this" requires correlation IDs and good event metadata.
- **Event storms / cascades.** One event triggers handlers that emit more events, which trigger more handlers. Without care this fans out unboundedly or forms cycles.

## Consumer failure and delivery guarantees

A direct function call has one obvious failure path: the caller sees the exception. An event has none of that clarity, so consumer failure needs an explicit policy. Three questions decide the design:

- **What happens when a consumer raises?** In a synchronous in-process bus, one failing handler can abort the others unless each is isolated. Decide whether a failing reaction should block its siblings or be contained.
- **What are the delivery semantics?** At-most-once (fire and drop on failure), at-least-once (retry until acknowledged, so consumers may see duplicates), or exactly-once (usually a fiction at the transport layer, approximated with idempotent consumers plus deduplication). Most durable brokers give at-least-once, which is why idempotency is not optional.
- **Where do poison messages go?** An event that always fails its consumer must not block the queue forever. A dead-letter queue captures repeatedly-failing events for inspection rather than retrying them infinitely.

The throughline: with direct calls the failure contract is implicit and obvious; with events you must design it deliberately, because the producer has walked away by the time anything goes wrong.

## Relationship to the Observer pattern

The Observer pattern is the smallest, in-process instance of event-driven design: a subject keeps a list of observers and notifies them on change. Event-driven architecture generalizes this — the "subject" becomes an event bus or broker, notification becomes publish, and observers become subscribers that may live in other processes or services. The same inversion of dependency applies; the difference is the transport, durability, and whether delivery is synchronous. When the decoupling is local and synchronous, plain Observer (or a simple callback list) is enough; reach for a broker only when you need cross-process delivery, durability, or async processing.

## Events vs commands

A distinction worth keeping clear: a *command* tells a specific handler to do something (`SendEmail`, `ChargeCard`) and expects it to happen; an *event* announces that something already happened (`OrderPaid`, `EmailSent`) and makes no demand about who reacts. Commands are directed and usually have exactly one handler; events are broadcast and may have zero, one, or many. Confusing the two — naming an event like a command, or treating a published event as if a particular consumer must handle it — quietly reintroduces the coupling event-driven design was meant to remove. Name events in the past tense as facts; if you find yourself caring *which* consumer runs, you probably wanted a direct call or a command, not an event.

## Synchronous vs asynchronous delivery

A choice that changes the whole character of an event system is whether `publish` blocks until handlers finish (synchronous) or hands off and returns immediately (asynchronous). Synchronous in-process delivery is simple to reason about — the producer's call stack still includes the handlers, exceptions propagate back, and ordering is deterministic — but it couples the producer's latency and failure to its consumers, which partly defeats the decoupling. Asynchronous delivery (a queue, a broker, a background task) restores the decoupling but introduces every distributed-systems concern: at-least-once delivery, ordering, partial failure, and the need for idempotent consumers. Pick synchronous when the reactions are cheap, local, and must complete before the producer continues; pick asynchronous when reactions are slow, remote, or genuinely independent of the producer's success.

## In Python

- In-process: a simple dict of `event_name -> list[callable]` is often all you need; do not pull in a message broker for local decoupling.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from collections.abc import Callable

class EventBus:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._subscribers: dict[str, list[Callable]] = defaultdict(list)

    def subscribe(self, event: str, handler: Callable) -> None:
        self._subscribers[event].append(handler)

    def publish(self, event: str, payload: object) -> None:
        for handler in self._subscribers[event]:
            handler(payload)   # producer never names a consumer
```

This is the whole pattern at the smallest scale: the publisher knows the event name and the payload, never the handlers. Everything bigger — a broker, durability, async delivery — is the same shape with more infrastructure.

- Frameworks provide signals/hooks (Django signals, Flask signals, pytest hooks) — prefer the framework's mechanism over a homegrown one when working inside it.
- Make event payloads plain data (`dataclass` / `TypedDict`) with a stable, versioned schema; this is the contract between producer and consumer.
- Design consumers to be idempotent and to log enough context (event ID, correlation ID) to trace failures.
- For async workflows, an emitted event usually becomes a task — see [async-concurrency.md](./async-concurrency.md) for owning the lifetime of that work rather than firing it and forgetting it.
- Keep the audit value honest: if events are your source of truth, treat the event schema with the same care as a database schema.
- Resist using events for flow that is really a direct request-response. If the producer needs the result, blocks on it, or only ever has one consumer, a plain function call is clearer than an event round-trip.
