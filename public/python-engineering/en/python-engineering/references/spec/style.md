# Code Style

Style in a Python project splits cleanly into two layers: the part a tool can decide and enforce mechanically, and the part that requires human judgment about meaning. Conflating them wastes review attention on things a formatter already settled and, worse, lets the things that actually matter — names, boundaries, abstraction level — slip through because everyone was arguing about line length. This document is about drawing that line and spending judgment only where it pays.

## The PEP 8 Baseline

PEP 8 is the default style substrate for Python: layout, indentation, imports, naming, comments, and a handful of programming recommendations. It is the shared baseline that makes unfamiliar Python code readable. But it is not a complete engineering specification — it says nothing about type boundaries, exception semantics, tooling, or architecture, and many of its concrete formatting rules predate modern auto-formatters. The right way to adopt PEP 8 is "follow it by default, allow local consistency and readability to win," not "transcribe every historical formatting clause into a hard rule."

## The Automation Boundary

The single most useful move in style management is to delegate everything mechanical to tools and stop discussing it.

A formatter (Ruff's formatter, or Black) owns layout: line wrapping, quote style, whitespace, trailing commas, bracket placement. These have no semantic content, so the only thing that matters is consistency, and a formatter delivers that for free. Once a formatter runs in pre-commit and CI, formatting is no longer a review topic — there is nothing to debate.

A linter (Ruff) owns the mechanically detectable: unused imports, import ordering, obviously dead code, outdated syntax that a modern target version supersedes, and a large catalog of bug-prone patterns. A linter is configured by selecting rule families deliberately rather than enabling everything; every rule added should earn its place against false-positive cost. Tooling specifics — which rule families, how they are configured — live in the tooling references; what matters here is the principle: if a rule can decide it, a human should not be deciding it in review.

What this leaves for human review is everything a tool *cannot* judge: whether a name communicates intent, whether a module has one responsibility, whether an abstraction is pulling its weight, whether the code says what it means. That is where style review attention belongs.

## Naming

Names are the highest-leverage style decision because they are read far more than written and no tool can evaluate them. Beyond PEP 8's mechanical conventions (`snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_CASE` for constants), the judgment is whether a name communicates intent at the point of use.

A name should describe what a thing *is* or *does* in the domain, not its type or its implementation. `users` beats `user_list`; `deadline` beats `dt2`; `is_expired` beats `flag`. Scope should guide length: a loop index can be `i`, a module-level function cannot. Avoid encoding type information a reader can already see from the annotation, and avoid abbreviations that save a few characters at the cost of a moment's decoding on every read. Booleans read best as predicates (`is_`, `has_`, `should_`); functions with side effects read best as verbs.

## Module Boundaries

A module should have a reason to exist that can be stated in one sentence. When a module accumulates unrelated responsibilities — request handling next to database access next to formatting helpers — every change touches it and every import drags in the whole pile. The judgment a tool cannot make is whether the things in a module belong together: do they change for the same reasons, are they at the same level of abstraction, would a reader looking for one expect to find the others. Cohesion is the test, not file size. A focused 400-line module is healthier than a 50-line grab-bag named `utils` that everything imports and nothing owns.

## Abstraction Level

Good code reads at a consistent level within any one function: a high-level orchestration function should call well-named steps, not interleave orchestration with byte-twiddling. Mixing levels — a function that both decides business policy and manipulates string indices — forces the reader to constantly shift mental gears. The corrective is not "more abstraction" but *consistent* abstraction: extract the low-level detail behind a name so the high-level function reads as a sequence of intentions. This is a judgment call with a real failure mode in the other direction (premature abstraction, indirection with no payoff), which is exactly why it cannot be automated.

## Explicitness

PEP 20's "explicit is better than implicit" is a style value, not a lint rule, and it shows up in dozens of small decisions: passing dependencies as arguments rather than reaching for globals, returning a named type rather than a bare tuple the caller must remember how to unpack, raising a specific exception rather than a bare `Exception`, naming a magic number as a constant. Explicitness trades a little brevity for a lot of readability and is almost always worth it at interface boundaries. The counterweight is that explicitness taken to an extreme becomes noise — spelling out what is already obvious from a good name or a clear type adds nothing. The judgment is whether making something explicit *reduces* the reader's work; when it does, prefer it.
